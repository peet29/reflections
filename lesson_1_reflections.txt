Using History for Efficiency

How did viewing a diff between two version of a 
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff will show the what part of the file that is 
not the same so I can easily see what change.
=======================================================
How could having easy access to the entire history of a 
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If I can access all the file history I can look in to 
history and see what I create and can compare file 
to see what did I do wrong.
=======================================================
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros I make each commit make sense by not have too many commit it
easy to look back in it.
Cons Sometime user might forgot to make a commit.
=======================================================
Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it will make the code function properly. For the code to work
if the file are connect it need to save together.
=======================================================
How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?

First use git log to find the commit id for the one that we want 
and then use git diff to compare the first commit and the one 
that we want.
=======================================================
How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?

If I use version control I don't have to worry about that 
the code will break because I can go back before I make change
very easy.
=======================================================
Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it to organize my code.
