When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

When I want to make my work public.
=======================================================
Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Because git may change something that I not commit if git auto pull 
it might change something that I don't want to.
=======================================================
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is like a copy of repository but I make it my own so I can change it.

Clones is a copy of repository. I can change it but it still the 
same as original. I can clones someone else repository but I can't make 
change to it if they don't want to.

Branches is just an id for commit.
